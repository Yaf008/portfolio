    <h1>Yajing Fang</h1>
    <p>I am a senior student at UCSD, majoring in Business Economics with a minor in Data Science. 
    I chose Data Science as my minor because I aspire to use its tools and techniques to analyze business and financial data. 
    My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to make informed decisions and drive impactful results in the field of finance and economics.</p>
